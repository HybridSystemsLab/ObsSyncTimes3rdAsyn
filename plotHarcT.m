% Description: yet another function for ploting hybrid arcs projected in the t-axis
% parameter dSample = 200 specifies the rate of down sampling, if there are more than
% dSample points for a line segment, it will resample the points according
% to the dSample rate, in turn, it generates a plot with much smaller file
% size for many cases. 
% Note: it will not work if the reason for too many data points is because
% of high frequency jumps. 
%
% sample usage: plotHarcT(t, j, x, 'r');
